# Arrays intro
## Deadline
27 of September 2021
## Description
This hometask is warm-up and intended to check your basic coding skills + to validate our workflow.

You are required to solve all problems from [this list](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/) + read related materials for every section.
It contains **19 problems** but you can skip problem [`Max Consecutive Ones II`](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/523/conclusion/3230/) because it's a premium one.

So, in order to get 100% score, **you have to solve 18 problems during one week**. Majority of them are easy one so I think that number of task is not so big.
