My trial to prepare my friends for coding interview


## How to submit your hometask?
- Create PR with name "**Your name** -- Hometask **deadline date**", e.g. _"BaLiK -- Hometask 19.09.21"_. It's better to create this PR in advance and mark it as a draft, just to not forget:) **Set me as a reviewer for this PR!**
- Your PR should have only diff that contains folder with name "**your name**-hometask-**deadline date**"(e.g. _balik-hometask-19-09-21_). In this folder you have to put code snippets of your solutions.
- Code snippet of solution it's just your code from Leetcode as a file with extension of your language. Naming pattern should be something like "**number of task-name of task.extension of your language**", e.g _"1-two-sum.cpp"_
- I can ask any questions related to your code during the review, you have to either to defend your opinion OR apply my proposal :)
- Also, be ready to explain general idea of your solution. Even if you found this solution somewhere in a web.
- If everything is okay, I will merge your solutions and ping you about your submission score.
